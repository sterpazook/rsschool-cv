### Summary
For the last 12 years I have been working for official Schneider Electric distributor in Belarus. My experience mainly includes wholesale supply, sales and support of Schneider Electric equipment. I also have experience in graphic design and PDH Microwave Radio Link Equipment commissioning.

I am advanced PC user: MS Office, Google Docs/Sheets, WEB, CRM, 1C, Slack, CorelDRAW. Basic level HTML, CSS, JS. I prefer Android gadgets and have some experience with Raspberry Pi.

Due to global events my current job may become irrelevant. So Iâ€™ve recently started studying the Web Development. Especially since I run my own web-site [SpiderMedia.ru](http://SpiderMedia.ru "Major russian-language portal about comic books and all things related") for more than 20 years.

I like movies and electronic music but my main hobbies are retro-games and original comic books such as Marvel, Image, DC, Avatar etc. I also officially translated some Marvel comic books for such publishers as Alden Comics and Jellyfish Jam.

Currently I am looking for a new job and open to any offers.

PS: No bad habits, married, have kids. Driving licence B.
